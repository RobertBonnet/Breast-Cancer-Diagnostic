# Breast-Cancer-Diagnostic

ðŸ§¬ Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification
Project Goal: Classify tumors as malignant or benign using biopsy data.
Summary:
Using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, a machine learning classifier was developed to predict the malignancy of tumors based on cell measurements. The project supports early detection in clinical settings, enhancing diagnostic accuracy.

Key Techniques & Tools:

Binary classification with logistic regression and random forests
Feature scaling and selection
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
Data visualization with Seaborn and Matplotlib
